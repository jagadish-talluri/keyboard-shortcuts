To all our dear readers in the U.S.:

Time is running out in 2016 to help Wikipedia. To protect our independence, we will never run ads. 
We are sustained by donations averaging about $15. Only a tiny portion of our readers give. 
Now is the time we ask. If everyone reading this right now gave $3, our fundraiser would be done within an hour. 
That's right, the price of a cup of coffee is all we need. 
If Wikipedia is useful to you, please take one minute to keep it online and growing. 
We are a non-profit with the costs of a top ten website: servers, staff and programs. 
We serve millions of readers, but we run on a fraction of what other top sites spend. 
We believe knowledge is a foundation. A foundation for human potential, for freedom, for opportunity. 
We believe everyone should have access to knowledgeâ€”for free, without restriction, without limitation. 
Please help us end the fundraiser and improve Wikipedia. Thank you.
